  description: "Albam, founded in 2006, has consistently produced high-quality, understated menswear with a vintage sportswear vibe to create a thoroughly contemporary brand. One of their earliest designs, the Fisherman's Cagoule, caused a stir in the menswear community for its bold-yet-simplistic design and modern cut, and is still sought-after today. Building on this early success, the brand continues to create the kind of casual yet sleek clothing that appeals to men the world over, all for a very reasonable price. Working alongside some of the UK and Europe's best fabric producers and manufacturers, Albam Clothing crafts timeless basics like t-shirts and sweatshirts with a garment-dyed twist, selvedge denim jeans and tailored pieces, alongside highly wearable outerwear, all ideal to mix and match with one another, or other pieces in your wardrobe for a classic casual look."
